Description: The 'coda' package (maintainer: Martyn Plummer
    <plummerm@iarc.fr> is commonly used to carry out Markov Chain
    Monte Carlo simulations, especially for the analysis of Bayesian
    hierarchical models in JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler - also
    maintained by Plummer).  Package 'coda' has a ton of built-in
    functions for viewing and assessing MCMC outputs, but the actual
    values it draws from posterior distributions tend to end up buried
    inside complex package-specific objects.  MCMCwrap provides wrapper
    functions for extracting MCMC posterior draws from mcmc.list objects,
    generated by coda and organizing them into arrays for easy plotting and 
    external diagnostics.
